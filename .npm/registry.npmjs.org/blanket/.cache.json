Easy to install\n2. Easy to use\n3. Easy to understand\n\nBlanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.\n\n## Mechanism\n\nJavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).\n\nBlanket works in a 3 step process:\n\n1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script\n2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.\n3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n## Install\n\nDownload the appropriate version of blanket.js for your test runner:  \n**QUnit**: [blanket.js for QUnit](https://raw.github.com/Migrii/blanket/live/dist/qunit/blanket.js)  \n\n**Mocha**: `npm install blanket`     \n\nOr [build it yourself](#roll-your-own).  \n\n\n## Configure\n\nReference the script in your test runner.\n\n**QUnit**: `<script src=\"blanket.js\"></script>`  \nThe add the data attribute `data-cover` to any script file you want covered.   \n(Ex: `<script src=\"mylibrary.js data-cover></script>` )  \n\nYou can also use a global filter with the data-cover-only attribute:\n\n`<script src=\"blanket.js\" data-cover-only=\"/src/\"></script>` or\n`<script src=\"blanket.js\" data-cover-only=\"['pattern1','pattern2']\"></script>` or\n`<script src=\"blanket.js\" data-cover-only=\"//regex//\"></script>`\n\n**Mocha**: `require(\"blanket\")(<pattern-for-source-files>);` The argument passed is a string (or regex) that refers to the folder where the source scripts are stored.  \n*Note: This require statement <strong>must</strong> be placed before the require statement of any scripts that you want covered.*  \n\nIn the browser, you can also avoid using the data-cover attributes by using a string/regex to denote which files to load:  \n`<script> blanket.loadOnly = \"/src/\"; </script>`  \nThis is useful in certain situations, and neccessary when your test runner uses requirejs to load your source files.\n\n## Use\n\n**QUnit**: Run the tests (with the 'Enable Coverage' box checked) and you'll see the coverage statistics appended below the test results.\n\n**Mocha**: Use the built-in reporters to output coverage details, i.e. `mocha -R html-cov > coverage.html`  \n\n## Custom Reporters\n\n**QUnit**: Custom reporters can be created to match your prefered test runner style.  See [simple_json_reporter.js](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/live/lib/reporters/simple_json_reporter.js) as an example.

See [json-cov](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/blob/master/lib/reporters/json-cov.js) as an example.\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nYou can use the [travis-cov](https://github.com/alex-seville/travis-cov) reporter, to integrate Blanket.js with an instance of Travis CI:\n\n1. `npm install travis-cov`\n2. Add to your package.json,  \n\n```   \n\"scripts\": {   \n         \"test\": \"mocha -R travis-cov\"   \n       },   \n       \"travis-cov-threshold\": <number>  \n```   \n\nIf your CI tests aren't run with mocha, but are instead run with qunit & phantomjs, you can use the following configuration:\n\n```     \n\"scripts\": {   \n         \"test\": \"phantomjs ./node_modules/travis-cov/phantom_runner.js path-to-your-testrunner <threshold-number>\"   \n       }  \n```   \n\nWhen you commit your code to Travis the coverage results will be compared against the threshold and will fail if any files fall below the threshold.\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:Migrii/blanket.git`  \n2. `cd /blanket/lib`  \n3. `node builder.js <runner>` where runner is qunit for browser based (for the moment).\n4. Your newly rolled file can be found at `/dist/qunit/blanket.js`\n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source will be created.  \nWe plan on adding a variety of different command line options to allow you to create a version of blanket customized for your needs.  \nLet us know what you'd like to see!\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the LIVE branch.  Ignore master, it is unused at the moment.**\n\nIf you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee the [FAQ in the Blanket Wiki](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/wiki/FAQ).\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the following people:\n\n* [alex-seville](https://github.com/alex-seville)\n* [dervalp](https://github.com/dervalp)\n* [morkai](https://github.com/morkai)\n* [flrent](https://github.com/flrent)\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis product is currently in beta release and is NOT stable or production ready.

See the [blanket package.json file](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/package.json#L43) as an example.\n\n* If you put the pattern in your package.json file, as above, you can simply add `require(\"blanket\")`. It will look first in your package.json and failing that it will default to `src`.\n\n* Use the object returned by the require statement to manually set the pattern:\n`var blanket = require(\"blanket\"); blanket.setFilter(\"lib\");`\n\n*Note: This require statement <strong>must</strong> be placed before the require statement of any scripts that you want covered.*  \n\n\n\n## Use\n\n**QUnit**: Run the tests (with the 'Enable Coverage' box checked) and you'll see the coverage statistics appended below the test results.\n\n**Mocha**: Use the built-in reporters to output coverage details, i.e. `mocha -R html-cov > coverage.html`  \n\n## Custom Reporters\n\n**QUnit**: Custom reporters can be created to match your prefered test runner style.

Add to your package.json,  \n\n```   \n\"scripts\": {   \n         \"test\": \"mocha -R travis-cov\"   \n       },   \n       \"travis-cov-threshold\": <number>  \n```   \n\nIf your CI tests aren't run with mocha, but are instead run with qunit & phantomjs, you can use the following configuration:\n\n```     \n\"scripts\": {   \n         \"test\": \"phantomjs ./node_modules/travis-cov/phantom_runner.js path-to-your-testrunner <threshold-number>\"   \n       }  \n```   \n\nWhen you commit your code to Travis the coverage results will be compared against the threshold and will fail if any files fall below the threshold.\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:Migrii/blanket.git`  \n2. `npm install`  \n3. `grunt buildit` \n4. Your newly rolled file can be found at `/dist/qunit/blanket.js`\n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source will be created.  \nWe plan on adding a variety of different command line options to allow you to create a version of blanket customized for your needs.  \nLet us know what you'd like to see!\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the MASTER branch.**\n\nIf you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee the [FAQ in the Blanket Wiki](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/wiki/FAQ).\n\nFeel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to [@alex_seville](http://www.twitter.com/alex_seville).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the following people:\n\n* [alex-seville](https://github.com/alex-seville)\n* [dervalp](https://github.com/dervalp)\n* [morkai](https://github.com/morkai)\n* [msaglietto](https://github.com/msaglietto)\n* [adambiggs](https://github.com/adambiggs)\n* [flrent](https://github.com/flrent)\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis product is currently in beta release and is NOT stable or production ready.

Easy to install\n2. Easy to use\n3. Easy to understand\n\nBlanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nJavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).\n\nBlanket works in a 3 step process:\n\n1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script\n2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.\n3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n\n## Compatibility and Features List\n\nSee the [Compatiblity and Feature List](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/compatibility_and_features.md) including links to working examples.\n\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:Migrii/blanket.git`  \n2. `npm install`  \n3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`\n3. `grunt buildit` \n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  \n\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the MASTER branch.**  \n**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**\n\nIf you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.\n\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to [@blanket_js](http://www.twitter.com/blanket_js).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the following people:\n\n* [alex-seville](https://github.com/alex-seville)\n* [dervalp](https://github.com/dervalp)\n* [morkai](https://github.com/morkai)\n* [msaglietto](https://github.com/msaglietto)\n* [adambiggs](https://github.com/adambiggs)\n* [ashwinr](https://github.com/ashwinr)\n* [provegard](https://github.com/provegard)\n* [orient-man](https://github.com/orient-man)\n* [tmrudick](https://github.com/tmrudick)\n* [wpreul](https://github.com/wpreul)\n* [xzyfer](https://github.com/xzyfer)\n* [flrent](https://github.com/flrent)\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n\n## Revision History\n\nFeb 7-13 - 1.0.4\nNode version can use the same input attributes as client side version, branchTracking reporting for client, use string, regex or array as filter for node, loading issue fixes for requirejs+blanket.\n\nJan 23-13 - 1.0.3\nDependencies fixed for node.

Easy to install\n2. Easy to use\n3. Easy to understand\n\nBlanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nJavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).\n\nBlanket works in a 3 step process:\n\n1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script\n2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.\n3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n## Grunt-blanket\n\nA Grunt plugin has been created to allow you to use Blanket like a \"traditional\" code coverage tool (creating instrumented copies of physical files, as opposed to live-instrumenting).\nThe plugin runs as a standlone project and can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-seville/grunt-blanket).\n\n\n## Compatibility and Features List\n\nSee the [Compatiblity and Feature List](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/compatibility_and_features.md) including links to working examples.\n\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:Migrii/blanket.git`  \n2. `npm install`  \n3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`\n3. `grunt buildit` \n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  \n\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the MASTER branch.**  \n**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**\n\nIf you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.\n\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to [@blanket_js](http://www.twitter.com/blanket_js).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the following people:\n\n* [alex-seville](https://github.com/alex-seville)\n* [dervalp](https://github.com/dervalp)\n* [morkai](https://github.com/morkai)\n* [msaglietto](https://github.com/msaglietto)\n* [adambiggs](https://github.com/adambiggs)\n* [ashwinr](https://github.com/ashwinr)\n* [provegard](https://github.com/provegard)\n* [orient-man](https://github.com/orient-man)\n* [tmrudick](https://github.com/tmrudick)\n* [wpreul](https://github.com/wpreul)\n* [xzyfer](https://github.com/xzyfer)\n* [flrent](https://github.com/flrent)\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n\n## Revision History\n\nFeb 12-13 - 1.0.6\nAdded debug setting to track program flow.

Easy to install\n2. Easy to use\n3. Easy to understand\n\nBlanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nJavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).\n\nBlanket works in a 3 step process:\n\n1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script\n2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.\n3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n## Grunt-blanket\n\nA Grunt plugin has been created to allow you to use Blanket like a \"traditional\" code coverage tool (creating instrumented copies of physical files, as opposed to live-instrumenting).\nThe plugin runs as a standlone project and can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-seville/grunt-blanket).\n\n\n## Compatibility and Features List\n\nSee the [Compatiblity and Feature List](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/compatibility_and_features.md) including links to working examples.\n\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:alex-seville/blanket.git`  \n2. `npm install`  \n3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`\n3. `grunt buildit` \n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  \n\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the MASTER branch.**  \n**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**\n\nIf you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.\n\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to [@blanket_js](http://www.twitter.com/blanket_js).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the following people:\n\n* [alex-seville](https://github.com/alex-seville)\n* [dervalp](https://github.com/dervalp)\n* [morkai](https://github.com/morkai)\n* [msaglietto](https://github.com/msaglietto)\n* [adambiggs](https://github.com/adambiggs)\n* [ashwinr](https://github.com/ashwinr)\n* [provegard](https://github.com/provegard)\n* [orient-man](https://github.com/orient-man)\n* [tmrudick](https://github.com/tmrudick)\n* [wpreul](https://github.com/wpreul)\n* [xzyfer](https://github.com/xzyfer)\n* [hasankhan](https://github.com/hasankhan)\n* [mohamedmansour](https://github.com/mohamedmansour)\n* [flrent](https://github.com/flrent)\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n\n## Revision History\n\nMar 22-13 - 1.1.0\nCustom variable data attribute to use whatever variable you want for coverage tracking.\n\nMar 22-13 - 1.0.9\nBlanket is not run on require in node now.

See [Special Features Guide](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/special_features.md) for more details and workarounds.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease see the following guides for using Blanket.js:\n\n**Browser**\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_browser.md) (Basic QUnit usage)\n* [Intermediate](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_browser.md) (Other test runners, global options)\n* [Advanced](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/advanced_browser.md) (writing your own reporters/adapters)\n* [Special Features Guide](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/special_features.md)\n\n**Node**\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md) (basic mocha setup)\n* [Intermediate](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_node.md) (mocha testrunner, travis-ci reporter)\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nBlanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be:\n\n1. Easy to install\n2. Easy to use\n3. Easy to understand\n\nBlanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nJavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).\n\nBlanket works in a 3 step process:\n\n1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script\n2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.\n3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n## Grunt-blanket\n\nA Grunt plugin has been created to allow you to use Blanket like a \"traditional\" code coverage tool (creating instrumented copies of physical files, as opposed to live-instrumenting).\nThe plugin runs as a standlone project and can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-seville/grunt-blanket).\n\n\n## Compatibility and Features List\n\nSee the [Compatiblity and Feature List](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/compatibility_and_features.md) including links to working examples.\n\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:alex-seville/blanket.git`  \n2. `npm install`  \n3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`\n3. `grunt buildit` \n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  \n\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the upcoming version branch (currently [1.1.3](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/tree/1.1.3)).**  \n**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**\n\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to [@blanket_js](http://www.twitter.com/blanket_js).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the following people:\n\n* [dervalp](https://github.com/dervalp)\n* [morkai](https://github.com/morkai)\n* [msaglietto](https://github.com/msaglietto)\n* [adambiggs](https://github.com/adambiggs)\n* [ashwinr](https://github.com/ashwinr)\n* [provegard](https://github.com/provegard)\n* [orient-man](https://github.com/orient-man)\n* [tmrudick](https://github.com/tmrudick)\n* [wpreul](https://github.com/wpreul)\n* [xzyfer](https://github.com/xzyfer)\n* [hasankhan](https://github.com/hasankhan)\n* [mohamedmansour](https://github.com/mohamedmansour)\n* [strife25](https://github.com/strife25)\n* [mclin](https://github.com/mclin)\n* [flrent](https://github.com/flrent)\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n## Roadmap\n\nv1.1.4  \nCoverage on-the-go (Displaying coverage results while a single page is being used).\n\n## Revision History\n\nApr 28-13 - 1.1.3\nYUI support added with custom adapter (and some wrapping code).

See [Special Features Guide](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/special_features.md) for more details and workarounds.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease see the following guides for using Blanket.js:\n\n**Browser**\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_browser.md) (Basic QUnit usage)\n* [Intermediate](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_browser.md) (Other test runners, global options)\n* [Advanced](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/advanced_browser.md) (writing your own reporters/adapters)\n* [Special Features Guide](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/special_features.md)\n\n**Node**\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md) (basic mocha setup)\n* [Intermediate](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_node.md) (mocha testrunner, travis-ci reporter)\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nBlanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be:\n\n1. Easy to install\n2. Easy to use\n3. Easy to understand\n\nBlanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nJavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).\n\nBlanket works in a 3 step process:\n\n1. Loading your source files\n2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.\n3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n## Grunt Integration\n\nYou've got a few options for using Grunt with Blanket:\n\n**grunt-blanket**\n\nA Grunt plugin has been created to allow you to use Blanket like a \"traditional\" code coverage tool (creating instrumented copies of physical files, as opposed to live-instrumenting).\nThe plugin runs as a standlone project and can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-seville/grunt-blanket).\n\n**grunt-blanket-qunit**\n\nRuns the QUnit-based Blanket report headlessly using PhantomJS.  Results are displayed on the console, and the task will cause Grunt to fail if any of your configured coverage thresholds are not met. Minimum code coverage thresholds can be configured per-file, per-module, and globally.\n\nSee:\n\n* [Plugin Repo](https://github.com/ModelN/grunt-blanket-qunit)\n* [Blog Walkthrough](http://www.geekdave.com/2013/07/20/code-coverage-enforcement-for-qunit-using-grunt-and-blanket/)\n\n## Compatibility and Features List\n\nSee the [Compatiblity and Feature List](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/compatibility_and_features.md) including links to working examples.\n\n\n## Roll your own\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:alex-seville/blanket.git`  \n2. `npm install`  \n3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`\n3. `grunt buildit` \n\nA minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  \n\n\n## Development\n\n**All development takes place on the `development` branch**  \n**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**\n\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to [@blanket_js](http://www.twitter.com/blanket_js).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to the [many people who have contributed](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/network/members) to the project.\n\nAnd thanks also to: [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/).\n\n## Roadmap\n\nv1.1.5 - Refactor reporter API. \n\n\n## Revision History\n\nMay 1-13 - 1.1.4  \nLoaded reverting for grunt-blanket, branch tracking reporter fixed, coverage on-the-go (displaying coverage results while a single page is being used).  \n  \nApr 28-13 - 1.1.3\nYUI support added with custom adapter (and some wrapping code).  CompoundJS support appears to be outside the scope of project.\n\n...

Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.\n\n## Install\n\nDownload the appropriate version of blanket.js for your test runner:  \n**QUnit**: [blanket.js for QUnit](https://raw.github.com/Migrii/blanket/live/dist/qunit/blanket.js)  \n**Mocha**: [blanket.js for Mocha](https://raw.github.com/Migrii/blanket/live/dist/mocha/blanket.js)   \n\nOr build it yourself by cloning the git repo, and then running `node builder.js <runner>` in /lib.  \n\nReference the script in your test runner.  \n**QUnit**:   `<script src=\"blanket.js\"></script>`  \n**Mocha**:   `require(\"path/to/blanket\");`  *Note: This require statement <strong>must</strong> be placed before the require statement of any scripts that you want covered.*  \n\n## Configure\n\n**QUnit**: Add the data attribute `data-cover` to any script file you want covered.   \n(Ex: `<script src=\"mylibrary.js data-cover></script>` )  \n**Mocha**: No additional configuration required.\n\n## Use\n\n**QUnit**: Run the tests (with the 'Enable Coverage' box checked) and you'll see the coverage statistics appended below the test results.\n**Mocha**: Use the built-in reporters to output coverage details, i.e. `mocha -R html-cov > coverage.html`  \n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis product is currently in beta release and is NOT stable or production ready.  It is subject to changes.  We appreciate any feedback or assistance.\n\n## Documentation\n_(Coming soon)_\n\n## Revision History\n\nNov-4-12 - 0.9.1\nWorks seamlessly with mocha (in node) and uses built in mocha reporters for coverage.\n\nOct-29-12 - 0.9.0\nInitial release of blanket.js.  Works with qunit, but coverage output is not complete.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 Alex-Seville  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"alexseville","email":"hi@alexanderseville.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2013-12-20T05:28:32.362Z","created":"2012-11-04T22:09:29.247Z","0.1.0":"2012-11-04T22:09:31.124Z","0.9.1":"2012-11-04T23:08:39.963Z","0.9.4":"2012-11-18T04:51:53.545Z","0.9.5":"2012-11-20T12:44:06.787Z","0.9.6":"2012-11-24T23:34:48.448Z","0.9.7":"2012-11-27T04:26:55.625Z","0.9.8":"2012-12-03T13:21:11.410Z","0.9.9":"2012-12-10T01:32:43.916Z","1.0.0":"2012-12-15T16:17:16.443Z","1.0.1":"2012-12-31T19:12:34.385Z","1.0.2":"2013-01-13T16:54:17.749Z","1.0.3":"2013-02-06T12:20:32.371Z","1.0.4":"2013-02-08T12:20:23.137Z","1.0.5":"2013-02-09T01:27:59.681Z","1.0.6":"2013-02-23T18:03:04.110Z","1.0.7":"2013-03-11T22:11:17.803Z","1.0.8":"2013-03-14T01:54:40.391Z","1.0.9":"2013-03-23T00:40:58.423Z","1.1.0":"2013-03-23T01:09:04.894Z","1.1.1":"2013-04-02T12:15:20.581Z","1.1.2":"2013-04-16T04:35:37.145Z","1.1.3":"2013-04-28T20:10:58.665Z","1.1.4":"2013-05-02T14:44:07.695Z","1.1.5":"2013-06-26T04:02:55.527Z","1.1.6":"2013-12-20T05:28:32.362Z"},"author":{"name":"Alex-Seville","email":"hi@alexanderseville.com","url":"http://blanketjs.org"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/alex-seville/blanket.git"},"users":{"meggesje":true,"forivall":true,"maxzhang":true,"hoitmort":true,"hellboy81":true,"mgesmundo":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"2RJCXLSRUYZGS6PZTJC44TQZ0\""}
