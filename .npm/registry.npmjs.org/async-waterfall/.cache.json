However, if any of the functions pass an error to the callback, the\nnext function is not executed and the main callback is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\nFor browsers and node.js.\n\n## Installation\n* Just include async-waterfall before your scripts.\n* `npm install async-waterfall` if you’re using node.js.\n* `component install es128/async-waterfall` if you’re using\n[component(1)](https://github.com/component/component).\n* `bower install async-waterfall` if you’re using\n[Twitter Bower](http://bower.io).\n\n## Usage\n\n* `waterfall(tasks, optionalCallback);`\n* **tasks** - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a\n`callback(err, result1, result2, ...)` it must call on completion. The first\nargument is an error (which can be null) and any further arguments will be\npassed as arguments in order to the next task.\n* **optionalCallback** - An optional callback to run once all the functions have\ncompleted. This will be passed the results of the last task's callback.\n\n#### Node.js:\n\n```javascript\nvar waterfall = require('async-waterfall');\nwaterfall([\n    function(callback){\n        callback(null, 'one', 'two');\n    },\n    function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n        callback(null, 'three');\n    },\n    function(arg1, callback){\n        // arg1 now equals 'three'\n        callback(null, 'done');\n    }\n], function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals 'done'\n});\n```\n\n#### Browser:\n\n```javascript\n// component(1)\nvar waterfall = require('async-waterfall');\nwaterfall(tasks, callback);\n\n// Default:\nwindow.asyncWaterfall(tasks, callback);\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\nHat tip to [Caolan McMahon](https://github.com/caolan) and\n[Paul Miller](https://github.com/paulmillr), whose prior contributions this is\nbased upon.\n\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
